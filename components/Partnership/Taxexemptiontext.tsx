          Tax Exemption on Donations to Paravidya Foundation (Section 80G)

          <p>
            Donating to <span className="font-semibold">Paravidya Foundation</span> is not only an
            act of Seva (selfless service) but also a financially rewarding decision. Under Indian
            law, your donations to NGOs registered under{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Section 80G of the Income Tax Act</span> qualify for
            deductions, reducing your taxable income.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What Does This Mean?</h2>
          <p>
            When you contribute to Paravidya Foundation, the donation amount can be deducted from
            your total taxable income while filing your Income Tax Return (ITR). This reduces your
            overall tax liability. For example, if your taxable income is â‚¹10,00,000 and you donate
            â‚¹50,000, your taxable income becomes â‚¹9,50,000 (subject to 50% or 100% deduction
            depending on the category).
