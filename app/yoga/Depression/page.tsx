        title="Understanding Depression and Mental Wellness" 
        description="Depression is a complex mood disorder that significantly impacts emotional regulation, cognitive function, and daily life activities. Unlike temporary sadness or stress, depression is a persistent condition affecting multiple dimensions of well-being over weeks or months. Common symptoms include sustained feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness; diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities; chronic fatigue and low energy; difficulty concentrating or making decisions; changes in sleep patterns or appetite; and overwhelming feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Depression results from a complex interplay of biological, psychological, environmental, and social factors. While professional medical treatment is essential, yoga can serve as a valuable complementary practice that supports mental health recovery by addressing stress, improving mood, and promoting overall emotional wellness."

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Family history of depression, genetic variations affecting neurotransmitter function (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine), and brain chemistry imbalances can increase susceptibility to depression. Hormonal changes during puberty, pregnancy, or menopause may also trigger depressive episodes.</p>

      <YogaHelp 
        title="How Yoga Supports Mental Health and Depression Recovery" 
        description="Yoga is highly beneficial in managing depression because it addresses the body, mind, and breath simultaneously, creating a holistic approach to mental health. Gentle yoga asanas, such as Surya Namaskar, Tadasana, and Balasana, improve blood circulation, release muscle tension, and stimulate the nervous system, which can help lift one's mood and reduce the lethargy often associated with depression. Breathing exercises such as Anulom Vilom, Bhramari, and Sheetali Pranayama calm the mind, regulate stress hormones, and reduce anxiety. Mindfulness practices, such as Yoga Nidra, guided meditation, or breath awareness, cultivate self-awareness, reduce negative thought patterns, and promote emotional balance. Additionally, participating in group yoga classes or partner yoga sessions offers social support, which can be particularly beneficial in combating feelings of isolation. By integrating physical movement, breath control, meditation, and social connection, regular yoga practice can improve mood, enhance resilience, and support overall mental well-being for those experiencing depression."
