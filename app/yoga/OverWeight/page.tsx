- **Better Sleep**: Yoga improves sleep quality, which regulates hunger hormones and supports metabolic health
- **Body Positivity**: Yoga philosophy promotes self-acceptance and healthy body image
- **Sustainable Habits**: Gentle, consistent practice creates lasting lifestyle changes rather than quick fixes"
