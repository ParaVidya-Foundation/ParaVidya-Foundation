        title="Understanding Healthy Weight Management" 
        description="Healthy weight management is about achieving and maintaining a weight that supports your overall well-being. Weight gain occurs when there's an imbalance between calories consumed and calories burned, leading to fat accumulation. While some weight fluctuation is natural, excessive weight gain can increase the risk of health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and joint problems. Yoga for weight loss offers a holistic approach that combines physical movement, mindful eating awareness, and stress reduction to support sustainable weight management and improved quality of life."

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Consuming calorie-dense foods high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and refined carbohydrates leads to excess fat storage. Poor portion control and irregular eating habits also contribute to weight gain.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Lack of regular physical activity slows down metabolism and reduces the body's ability to burn calories effectively. Extended periods of sitting and minimal movement compound this issue.</p>

        title="How Yoga Supports Healthy Weight Management" 
        description="Yoga provides comprehensive support for sustainable weight management through multiple interconnected benefits:

**Physical Benefits:**
- **Metabolic Enhancement**: Dynamic yoga sequences like Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) and Vinyasa flows increase heart rate, burn calories, and build lean muscle mass
- **Improved Flexibility and Strength**: Regular asana practice tones muscles, improves posture, and increases overall physical fitness
- **Better Digestion**: Twisting poses, forward folds, and breathing exercises massage internal organs, supporting healthy digestion and elimination

**Mental and Emotional Benefits:**
- **Stress Reduction**: Pranayama and meditation lower cortisol levels, reducing stress-induced weight gain and emotional eating patterns
- **Mindful Awareness**: Yoga cultivates present-moment awareness, helping develop conscious eating habits and better relationship with food
- **Improved Sleep Quality**: Regular practice regulates sleep patterns, which balances hunger hormones like leptin and ghrelin

**Holistic Lifestyle Support:**
- **Body Positivity**: Yoga philosophy promotes self-acceptance and appreciation for your body's capabilities rather than focusing solely on appearance
- **Sustainable Habits**: Gentle, consistent practice creates lasting lifestyle changes that support long-term weight management without extreme measures
- **Community Support**: Group yoga classes provide motivation, accountability, and social connection on your wellness journey"
