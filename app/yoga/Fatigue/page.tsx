        title="Understanding Fatigue and Energy Depletion" 
        description="Fatigue is a persistent state of physical and mental exhaustion that goes beyond normal tiredness. It's characterized by feeling drained, unmotivated, and low on energy, even after adequate rest or sleep. Unlike simple tiredness that resolves with rest, fatigue affects both body and mind, making it difficult to concentrate, complete daily tasks, or maintain motivation. Chronic fatigue can significantly impact quality of life, productivity, and overall well-being. Yoga for fatigue offers a natural, holistic approach to restore energy by addressing the root causes through gentle movement, energizing breathwork, and stress-reducing practices."

      <YogaHelp 
        title="How Yoga Naturally Combats Fatigue and Restores Energy" 
        description="Yoga is highly effective in managing and preventing fatigue because it works on both the body and mind to restore energy and vitality. Gentle yoga asanas, such as Surya Namaskar, Balasana, Viparita Karani, and Tadasana, improve blood circulation, release muscle tension, and strengthen the body, thereby helping to reduce physical exhaustion. Breathing exercises such as Anulom Vilom, Kapalabhati, and Bhramari enhance oxygen flow, calm the nervous system, and refresh mental energy, combating the mental sluggishness that often accompanies fatigue. Practices like Yoga Nidra and meditation promote deep relaxation, rejuvenate the mind, and restore balance, making it easier to recover from tiredness. Even light stretching and mindful movement throughout the day improve flexibility, circulation, and overall stamina. By combining asanas, pranayama, meditation, and gentle movement, yoga helps replenish energy, reduce stress, and maintain sustained physical and mental vitality."
