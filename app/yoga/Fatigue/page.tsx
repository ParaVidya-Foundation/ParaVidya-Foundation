        title="Understanding Fatigue and Energy Depletion" 
        description="Fatigue is a persistent state of physical and mental exhaustion that goes beyond normal tiredness. It's characterized by feeling drained, unmotivated, and low on energy, even after adequate rest or sleep. Unlike simple tiredness that resolves with rest, fatigue affects both body and mind, making it difficult to concentrate, complete daily tasks, or maintain motivation. Chronic fatigue can significantly impact quality of life, productivity, and overall well-being. Yoga for fatigue offers a natural, holistic approach to restore energy by addressing the root causes through gentle movement, energizing breathwork, and stress-reducing practices."

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Insufficient sleep (less than 7-8 hours), poor sleep quality, sleep apnea, or irregular sleep patterns disrupt the body's natural recovery and energy restoration processes, leading to persistent tiredness.</p>

      <YogaHelp 
        title="How Yoga Naturally Combats Fatigue and Restores Energy" 
        description="Yoga offers a comprehensive, natural approach to overcoming fatigue by addressing its root causes and systematically restoring energy on multiple levels:

**Physical Energy Restoration:**
- **Enhanced Circulation**: Dynamic poses like Surya Namaskar and gentle backbends improve blood flow, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tired muscles and organs
- **Nervous System Activation**: Energizing sequences stimulate the sympathetic nervous system when needed while balancing it with parasympathetic recovery
- **Muscle Tension Release**: Gentle stretching and restorative poses release chronic tension that drains energy, allowing for better energy flow throughout the body
- **Improved Sleep Quality**: Regular yoga practice regulates circadian rhythms and promotes deeper, more restorative sleep

**Mental and Emotional Energy Boost:**
- **Stress Hormone Regulation**: Pranayama and meditation reduce cortisol levels, preventing stress-induced fatigue and adrenal exhaustion
- **Mental Clarity Enhancement**: Breathing exercises increase oxygen to the brain, combating mental fog and improving focus and concentration
- **Mood Elevation**: Yoga stimulates the release of endorphins and serotonin, naturally lifting mood and motivation levels

**Energetic and Spiritual Vitality:**
- **Prana (Life Force) Cultivation**: Pranayama practices directly work with life energy, increasing vitality and reducing feelings of depletion
- **Chakra Balancing**: Specific poses help balance energy centers, ensuring smooth energy flow throughout the body
- **Mindful Awareness**: Present-moment awareness prevents energy drain from worry about the future or regret about the past

**Sustainable Energy Management:**
- **Gradual Building**: Unlike stimulants that create energy spikes and crashes, yoga builds sustainable energy reserves over time
- **Personalized Practice**: Yoga can be adapted to your energy levels - gentle when tired, more dynamic when energized
- **Holistic Lifestyle**: Yoga philosophy encourages energy-supporting habits including proper nutrition, adequate rest, and stress management

By combining physical movement, conscious breathing, meditation, and mindful living, yoga creates a natural, sustainable solution to fatigue that addresses both symptoms and underlying causes."
