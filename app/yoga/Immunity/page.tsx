        title="Understanding Your Immune System" 
        description="Your immune system is your body's natural defense network that protects against illness and infection. In yoga philosophy, immunity is connected to Ojas (vital essence) - the foundation of resilience and vitality. When stress, poor nutrition, lack of sleep, and toxins weaken this vital energy, our immune system becomes compromised. Yoga for immunity strengthens the body's natural defenses through the powerful combination of asanas (postures) that improve circulation, pranayama (breathing exercises) that boost lung capacity and oxygenation, and meditation that reduces stress hormones. This holistic approach fortifies the immune system, nurtures Tejas (inner radiance), and promotes lasting health and vitality."

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Lack of essential vitamins (especially C, D, and zinc), minerals, and antioxidants weakens the body's ability to fight infections. Processed foods and sugar can further suppress immune function.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Prolonged stress elevates cortisol levels, which suppresses immune cell activity and increases vulnerability to illnesses. Mental exhaustion further compromises the body's defense mechanisms.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Insufficient sleep (less than 7-8 hours) impairs the production of infection-fighting cells, antibodies, and cytokines. Poor sleep quality disrupts the body's natural healing processes.</p>

        title="How Yoga Naturally Strengthens Your Immunity" 
        description="Yoga provides comprehensive immune system support through a multi-dimensional approach that addresses physical, mental, and energetic aspects of health:

**Physical Immune Enhancement:**
- **Improved Circulation**: Asanas like inversions and twists boost blood flow and lymphatic drainage, helping remove toxins and distribute immune cells throughout the body
- **Respiratory Strengthening**: Pranayama techniques increase lung capacity, improve oxygenation, and strengthen respiratory immunity against infections
- **Glandular Stimulation**: Specific poses stimulate the thymus gland, lymph nodes, and other immune-supporting organs

**Stress Reduction and Hormonal Balance:**
- **Cortisol Regulation**: Regular yoga practice significantly reduces cortisol levels, preventing stress-induced immune suppression
- **Nervous System Balance**: Meditation and pranayama activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting rest, repair, and immune function
- **Better Sleep Quality**: Improved sleep through yoga practice enhances immune cell production and antibody formation

**Holistic Wellness Support:**
- **Digestive Health**: Twisting poses and breathing exercises improve gut health, where 70% of immune cells are located
- **Mental Clarity**: Reduced anxiety and improved mood support overall health and immune resilience
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Yoga philosophy encourages healthy habits including proper nutrition, adequate rest, and mindful living

By combining gentle movement, conscious breathing, and mindful relaxation, yoga creates an optimal internal environment for immune system function, helping your body naturally resist infections, recover faster from illness, and maintain vibrant long-term health."
