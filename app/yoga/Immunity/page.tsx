        title="Understanding Immunity" 
        description="Immunity is your body's complex defense system that protects against harmful pathogens, toxins, and diseases. A strong immune system is essential for overall health and vitality.

Key components of immunity:
- Physical barriers (skin, mucous membranes)
- White blood cells that fight infections
- Antibodies that recognize and neutralize threats
- Lymphatic system that removes toxins and waste
- Gut health and microbiome balance

Factors that can weaken immunity:
- Chronic stress and poor sleep
- Sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise
- Poor nutrition and dehydration
- Environmental toxins and pollution
- Smoking, excessive alcohol, and unhealthy habits

Yoga practices can significantly support and strengthen your immune system naturally."
