        title="What is Kirtan?" 
        description="Kirtan is a devotional practice in which sacred mantras, names of deities, or spiritual verses are sung or chanted, often in a call-and-response style. Rooted in the Bhakti tradition of India, kirtan combines music, rhythm, and repetition to create a meditative and uplifting experience. It is not just singing but a form of spiritual expression that opens the heart, calms the mind, and connects individuals with the divine. Kirtan is usually performed with instruments like the harmonium, tabla, or kartal, and its collective nature makes it a powerful practice for unity, joy, and inner peace."
