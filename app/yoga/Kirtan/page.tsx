        title="What is Kirtan?" 
        description="Kirtan is a form of devotional chanting and singing that originated in ancient India. It's a heart-centered practice that combines music, meditation, and spiritual connection to create a profound inner experience.

Key aspects of Kirtan:
- **Call and Response**: Simple mantras or sacred phrases repeated in a group setting
- **Sacred Sound**: The vibrational quality of Sanskrit mantras and devotional music
- **Community Connection**: Shared spiritual experience that creates unity and harmony
- **Heart Opening**: Practices that cultivate love, compassion, and spiritual awareness
- **Meditation in Motion**: Active meditation through chanting, movement, and breath

Kirtan is not about performance or perfection, but about opening the heart, quieting the mind, and connecting with the divine essence within and around us."
