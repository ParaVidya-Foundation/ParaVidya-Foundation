        title="What is Sleep?" 
        description="Sleep is a vital biological process that allows your body and mind to rest, recover, and rejuvenate. Quality sleep is essential for:

- Physical health and immune function
- Mental clarity and cognitive performance
- Emotional regulation and mood stability
- Memory consolidation and learning
- Cellular repair and hormone production

When sleep is disrupted or insufficient, it can lead to fatigue, irritability, weakened immunity, and difficulty concentrating. Sleep disorders can stem from stress, anxiety, poor sleep hygiene, or underlying health conditions."
